res_move
========

Simple PHP script to transfer Reddit Enhancement Suite settings between browsers on a single system.  

You can run this on the command line.  Make sure that you can execute the script directly (chmod +x res_move.php) and run ./res_move.php.  You must have PHP 5 installed, which most Macs do.
